```

## 3. Fork the Project
Go to the GitHub repository page and click on the Fork button in the top-right corner to create a copy under your account.

## 4. Clone Your Fork

cd project_name

# SSH (recommended)
git clone git@github.com:<your_account>/loan-risk-predictor.git
cd project_name

## 5. Add the Original Repository as a Remote (upstream)
This allows you to keep your fork up to date with the main project:

``` bash

git remote add upstream https://github.com/JiaLong0209/loan-risk-predictor.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v

``` bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
``` 

## 7. Commit and Push Changes
After editing the code:

``` bash
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"

# Push to your GitHub  repository
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

## 8. Submit ta Pull Request (PR)

2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button.

3. Add a meaningful description and submit the PR.

4. Wait for a maintainer to review and merge it.


## 9. Keep Your Fork in Sync
Regularly sync your fork with the main repository to stay updated:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

## 10. Delete Merged Branches (Optional)

Once your PR is merged, you can clean up your branches:

``` bash
# Delete the local branch
